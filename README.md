# Cricket Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes cricket player performance data using **Python** and various data science libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The goal of this analysis is to extract insights from player statistics and create visualizations to help understand trends and patterns in cricket performance over the years.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, replacing invalid data, and converting data types.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing cricket player statistics like runs, wickets, batting average, strike rate, and much more.
- **Visualization**: Various plots such as:
  - Top run-scorers bar plot
  - Runs vs Wickets scatter plot
  - Average runs per year line plot
- **Statistical Tests**: Conducting hypothesis tests and applying distributions like normal, Poisson, etc., for deeper insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations on arrays.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **SciPy**: For statistical functions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains statistics for various cricket players across multiple years. The data includes:
- Player names
- Matches played
- Runs scored
- Wickets taken
- Batting and bowling averages
- Additional player performance metrics
